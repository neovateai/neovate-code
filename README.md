**Neovate**, pronounced as `['niːəʊveɪt]`, is a **coding agent** to enhance your development workflow. You can use it to generate code, fix bugs, review code, add tests, and more.

✨ See more at [neovateai.dev](https://neovateai.dev).

## Quick Start

Ready to try Neovate Code? Getting started is simple:

```bash
npm install -g @neovate/code
neovate
```

We respect the API KEY environment variable for all providers. If you don't have an API Key, enter `/login`, select a provider, open the website, and enter the API Key.

Then enter `/model` to select a model of that provider.

Then you can start to use Neovate Code, describe what you want to do in the command line, review proposed changes and approve tools calls.

```bash
# Examples of what you can do:
"Add error handling to the user authentication function"
"Refactor this component to use TypeScript"
"Create unit tests for the payment service"
"Optimize this database query"
```

Visit our [quickstart](https://neovateai.dev/en/docs/quickstart) documentation for detailed installation and setup instructions.
