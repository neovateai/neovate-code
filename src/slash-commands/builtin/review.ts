1. If no PR number is provided in the args, use bash("git --no-pager diff --cached -- . ${lockFilesPattern}") to get the diff
2. If a PR number is provided, use bash("gh pr diff <number>") to get the diff
3. Analyze the changes and provide a thorough code review that includes:
   - Overview of what the PR does
   - Analysis of code quality and style
   - Specific suggestions for improvements
   - Any potential issues or risks

Keep your review concise but thorough. Focus on:
- Code quality and maintainability
- Security vulnerabilities
- Performance implications
- Test coverage
- Documentation completeness
- Breaking changes
- Consistency with codebase patterns

Format your review with clear sections and bullet points.
